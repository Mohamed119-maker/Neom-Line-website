               </p >
               <p class="my-3">Let's get started!

               </p >
               <p class="my-3">Trading Terminology

               </p >
               <p class="my-3">Forex trading has its own language, and it's important for beginners to become familiar with the terminology used in the industry. Here are some common terms you'll come across when trading forex:

               </p >
               <p class="my-3">Pip: A pip is the smallest unit of measurement in forex trading. Most currency pairs are quoted to four decimal places, so a pip is equal to 0.0001. For example, if the EUR/USD pair moves from 1.2500 to 1.2501, it has increased by one pip.

               </p >
               <p class="my-3">Pipette: A pipette is a fractional pip, used to indicate smaller changes in price. For example, a currency pair that moves from 1.25005 to 1.25006 has moved one pipette.

               </p >
               <p class="my-3">Currency pair: A currency pair is the combination of two currencies being traded in the forex market. For example, the EUR/USD currency pair represents the euro and the US dollar.

               </p >
               <p class="my-3">Base currency: In a currency pair, the base currency is the first currency listed. For example, in the USD/JPY currency pair, the US dollar is the base currency.

               </p >
               <p class="my-3">Quote currency: In a currency pair, the quote currency is the second currency listed. For example, in the USD/JPY currency pair, the Japanese yen is the quote currency.

               </p >
               <p class="my-3">Bid price: The bid price is the price at which a broker is willing to buy a currency pair. Ask price: The ask price is the price at which a broker is willing to sell a currency pair.

               </p >
               <p class="my-3">Spread: The spread is the difference between the bid price (the price at which you can sell a currency pair) and the ask price (the price at which you can buy a currency pair). Brokers make money by charging a spread on each trade, so it's important to choose a broker with competitive spreads.

               </p >
               <p class="my-3">Leverage: Leverage allows traders to control a larger position than they would be able to with their own capital. For example, if a broker offers 100:1 leverage, a trader can control a position worth $100,000 with just $1,000 of their own capital. However, leverage also increases the risk of losses, so it's important to use it wisely.

               </p >
               <p class="my-3">Margin: Margin is the amount of money required to open a position. Brokers require traders to put up a certain amount of margin as collateral in order to cover potential losses. The amount of margin required varies depending on the broker and the currency pair being traded.

               </p >
               <p class="my-3">Stop-loss: A stop-loss is an order placed to close a position at a certain price in order to limit losses. For example, if a trader buys the EUR/USD pair at 1.2500 and sets a stop-loss at 1.2450, the position will be automatically closed if the price falls to 1.2450, limiting the trader's losses.

               </p >
               <p class="my-3">Take-profit: A take-profit is an order placed to close a position at a certain price in order to lock in profits. For example, if a trader buys the EUR/USD pair at 1.2500 and sets a take-profit at 1.2550, the position will be automatically closed if the price rises to 1.2550, locking in the trader's profits.

               </p >
               <p class="my-3">Order types: There are several types of orders that traders can use to enter and exit positions. Some common order types include market orders (orders executed at the current market price), limit orders (orders to buy or sell at a specific price or better), and stop orders (orders to buy or sell once the price reaches a certain level).

                   </p >
               <p class="my-3">Limit order: A limit order is an order to buy or sell a currency pair at a specific price or better. Stop Order: An order to buy or sell a currency pair once it reaches a certain price.

               </p >
               <p class="my-3">Trailing Stop: is an advanced type of stop-loss order that adjusts automatically as the price of an asset fluctuates, allowing investors to limit their potential losses while also locking in profits.

               </p >
               <p class="my-3">Market order: A market order is an order to buy or sell a currency pair at the current market price.

               </p >
               <p class="my-3">Long position: A long position is a trade in which a trader buys a currency pair with the expectation that its value will increase.

               </p >
               <p class="my-3">Short position: A short position is a trade in which a trader sells a currency pair with the expectation that its value will decrease.

               </p >
               <p class="my-3">Liquidity: The amount of actual trading of a particular currency in the market. If the market is highly liquid, it means that there are a lot of traders willing to trade in the currency, which means that the currency will be more amenable to buying and selling at a reasonable price. In general, major currency pairs are more liquid than minor or exotic currency pairs.

               </p >
               <p class="my-3">Volatility: Volatility refers to the degree of price fluctuation in a currency pair. Highly volatile currency pairs can provide opportunities for large profits, but also come with increased risk.

               </p >
               <p class="my-3">Balance: This amount is equivalent to the sum of the initial deposit and the profits or losses realized from closed positions.

               </p >
               <p class="my-3">Equity: Equity is the amount of money that a trader has in their account, including profits and losses from open positions.

               </p >
               <p class="my-3">Initial margin: Initial margin is the amount of money required to open a position, expressed as a percentage of the total position size.

               </p >
               <p class="my-3">Margin call: A margin call occurs when a trader's account balance falls below the required margin for their open positions. When this happens, the trader is required to add more funds to their account or close some of their positions to avoid a margin call.

               </p >
               <p class="my-3">Carry trade: A carry trade is a trading strategy in which a trader borrows money in a currency with a low interest rate and invests it in a currency with a higher interest rate, profiting from the interest rate differential.

               </p >
               <p class="my-3">Central bank: A central bank is a national bank that controls a country's monetary policy and regulates its banking system. Central banks can have a significant impact on currency prices through their policy decisions.

               </p >
               <p class="my-3">Currency intervention: Currency intervention occurs when a central bank or government takes action to influence the value of its currency in the forex market, such as buying or selling large amounts of its currency.

               </p >
               <p class="my-3">Economic indicators: Economic indicators are statistics that provide information about the health of a country's economy, such as GDP, inflation, and unemployment. These indicators can affect currency prices by influencing market sentiment and expectations.

               </p >
               <p class="my-3">Fibonacci retracement: Fibonacci retracement is a technical analysis tool that uses horizontal lines to indicate areas of support or resistance at the key Fibonacci levels before a currency pair moves in the original direction.

               </p >
               <p class="my-3">Hedging: Hedging is a risk management technique used to offset potential losses in one position by taking an opposite position in another market or currency pair.

               </p >
               <p class="my-3">Interbank market: The interbank market is a network of banks that trade currencies with each other at market-determined exchange rates.

               </p >
               <p class="my-3">Moving average: A moving average is a technical analysis tool that calculates the average price of a currency pair over a specified period of time, used to identify trends and potential trade opportunities.

               </p >
